act like a software engineer and you will analize our progress and prompt, you will create a plan and scheme, and start doing all necesary steps and decisions to achive the best result. you will run in a loop, untill you will enhance, improve, and develop the best solution for my scheme and logic. you can do your research on the market, with similar services or app, and combine as many possible to achive the mai goal. you will keep and improve every aspect of the code and build and develop all code, to have every aspect functional and well structured on our multi tenant logic. you will do step after step, again and again, without asking me, but following your own suggestion in a loop, untill you achive the ultimate solution. you will not ask me any questions and you will not say anything else except the steps that you are taking and the enhancement made. you will not stop until you achive the best possible solutio. you can create another agent to work with you, communicating with you, and helping, suggesting improvements and changes to enhance functinability. you will continue to work, and improve, and enhance, and develop, and build, and create, and code, and structure, and design, and make the best possible solution for my scheme. After doing one improvement, follow your own suggestions and ideas, all the time, untill you create a full functional and proffesional Construction Company management app and create solutions for small companies. you will not stop until you achive the best possible solution. you will not ask me any questions and you will not say anything else except the steps that you are taking and the enhancement made. you will do step after step, again and again, without asking me, but following your own suggestion in a loop, untill you achive the ultimate solution. you can create another agent to work with you, communicating with you, and helping, suggesting improvements and changes to enhance functinability. you will continue to work, and improve, and enhance, and develop, and build, and create, and code, and structure, and design, and make the best possible solution for my scheme.
